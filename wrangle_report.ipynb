    "I was given the twitter-archive-enhanced.csv file which contains data for the tweeter user @weRateDogs tweet \n",
    "archive. I loaded the csv file into a dataframe using the pandas method `read_csv()`. However, this data isn't sufficient for the analysis required, so, I had to gather data from other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stages of wrangling done in the project can be identified as \n",
    "1. Gather\n",
    "2. Access\n",
    "3. Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gather**: I gathered data from 2 other sources.\n",
    "A. From a provided url, using the `Request` library: This data contains the `image_description` data. To gather this data, the content from the url was downloaded and written into a .tsv file.\n",
    "B. From an API call: The twitter API was used here. I needed additional information such as the retweet_count and the favorite_count which can only be fetched from the API. This data was fetched from the API and saved in a file called `tweet_json.txt`.\n",
    "At the end of the gathering phase, I have 3 different dataframes that represented my data from all 3 sources, `df_twitter_archive`, `df_image_prediction` and `df_tweet_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access**: At the accessing stage, I went through all of these 3 dataframes to identify issues with their content that. The issues identified can be categorized into the `Quality Issues` and `Tidyness Issues`. The assessment was done both visually and programatically. The issues are identified using pandas method such as `value_counts()`, `describe()`, `sort_values()` on all the dataframes I have. The following issues are identified \n",
    "#### Quality issues\n",
    "##### df_twitter_archive table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Missing data on `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp`, drop these columns as they have very little non null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.`expanded_urls`has incomplete data of 2297 out of 2367\n",
    "\n",
    "3.We only want original tweets, not retweeted data. This table has retweeted data i.e data with `retweeted_status_id` not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.`timestamp` column is of type object instead of type datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### df_image_prediction table:\n",
    "\n",
    "5.The prediction columns `p1`, `p2`, `p3` values are separated by underscore instead of space. Eg `Old_English_sheepdog` should be `Old English sheepdog` \n",
    "\n",
    "6.Inconsistent case for `p1`, `p2` and `p3` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Missing records 2075 instead of 2356\n",
    "\n",
    "##### df_tweet_data table:\n",
    "8.We do not need tweets from August 1, 2017. Data from this date should be excluded from analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness issues\n",
    "1.Four different columns for dog type on df_twitter_archive table (`doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, `puppo`) should be colapsed into one\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The `favorite_count` and `retweet_count` column of the `df_tweet_data` should be added to the grand table. The other columns already exists on the table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clean**: Cleaning is the last phase of the wrangling process where all the identified issues are rectified. This was donw using methods like `drop()` to drop columns not required, `fillna()` to fill missing values amongst others.\n",
    "During cleaning, I got a grand master dataframe referred to as `df_rate_dog_tweets`, that has all the cleaned data in just one file. The clean data is saved to csv file using the `to_csv()` method afterwatrds.\n"
